This is a scorer for senseval2, 2001.  answers are one per line in the form

	<item> <instance> <answer> [ <answer> [ ... ]] [<comment>]

<item> is a lexical item, sometimes just a word, sometimes it notes a
word plus a part of speech.  for example, "fish" or "fish-v"

<instance> is an arbitrary identitier -- cannot contain whitespace.

<answer> is in the form [^ \\t/]+ followed by an optional "/" plus
weight.

a <comment> is in the form "!![^\\n]*"

answers will be compared against a key.  both answers and keys are in
the format described above. additionally, a sense map may be supplied
which provides a subsumption table of the scores.

a sensemap is in the form

<subsummee>[ <numsubsumed> <subsumer>]

HISTORY: a replica of Joseph Rosenzweig's scoring software, rewritten to be
more robust about the format of answers.
